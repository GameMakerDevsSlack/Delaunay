# Delaunay
### @jujuadams

Demonstrates the Delaunay triangle decomposition algorithm. This is not written in a particularly efficient way but should serve basic needs. Triangle decomposition is typically used to break down complex shapes into triangles ready for rendering (or collision detection). Delaunay's algorithm tries to ensure triangles are as non-thin as possible which is often useful for cleaner rendering and more reliable collision detection.

Additionally, a pathfinding example is included that breaks up a space into navigable nodes. The algo is Dijkstra: not the most efficient but good enough.
